## üìå Overview
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), remains a leading infectious disease worldwide. This project provides a **computational pipeline** for constructing **competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks** to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs that regulate host immune responses during Mtb infection.

Key features:
- Differential gene expression analysis  
- lncRNA‚ÄìmiRNA‚ÄìmRNA interaction prediction  
- ceRNA network construction and visualization  
- Hub gene prioritization based on network centrality (MCC)  
- Functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways)  
- External validation using RummaGEO datasets  
- Tissue-specific and single-cell expression profiling of biomarkers
